# Task Management

## Planning Workflow

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## File Structure

Maintain these files in the project root:

```
tasks/
├── todo.md       # Current task plan with checkboxes
└── lessons.md    # Patterns learned from corrections
```

## todo.md Format

```markdown
# Current Task: [Task Name]

## Plan
- [ ] Step 1: Description
- [ ] Step 2: Description
- [ ] Step 3: Description

## Progress Notes
- [timestamp] Completed step 1, found issue X
- [timestamp] Step 2 required adjustment because Y

## Review
- What worked well
- What could be improved
```

## lessons.md Format

```markdown
# Lessons Learned

## [Date] - [Category]
**Mistake**: What went wrong
**Pattern**: The underlying pattern to avoid
**Rule**: Concrete rule to prevent recurrence

```

## When to Update

- **todo.md**: At task start, during progress, at completion
- **lessons.md**: After ANY user correction or discovered mistake
