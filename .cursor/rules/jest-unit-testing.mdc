This rule aims to improve the quality and consistency of unit tests by suggesting best practices for mocking in Jest:
- Prefer setting up mocks globally rather than mocking in each test or file individually.
- Encourage reusability and maintainability of mocks by centralizing their configuration.
- Reduce repeated mock setups and promote cleaner test files.
- Additional best practices for clear and reliable unit testing can be included as needed.
