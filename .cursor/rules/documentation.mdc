# Documentation Rules

## Cursor Documentation Policy

**Rule:** Update all relevant documentation with every code change—unless there is genuinely nothing meaningful to document. Documentation should be clear, accurate, and as concise as possible to avoid unnecessary clutter.

Required documentation updates include the following:

- **Code documentation:** Maintain or add JSDoc comments, inline comments, and TypeScript typings as needed.
    - Only add explanatory comments where logic is not immediately obvious—prefer self-explanatory code. Use comments to explain intent or rationale, *not* to restate what the code does.
- **README.md:** Revise if you introduce new features, change APIs, or update how the software is used.
- **API documentation:** Update or add docs if you modify or add API endpoints, types, or services.
- **Architecture documentation:** Adjust when making changes to project structure, key architectural patterns, or how folders and files are organized.
- **Usage examples:** Include usage examples only when they provide meaningful clarity or demonstrate important functionality.
- **Copilot or automation instructions:** Revise as needed whenever related guidance or prompts change.

**Summary:**
If you touch code, touch the docs. Never leave documentation out of date with reality, but also don't write docs for things that are obvious in context.

## Enforcement Checklist

Before completing any task, verify:

- [ ] JSDoc added/updated for new functions, classes, interfaces -
- [ ] README.md or other docs updated as needed
- [ ] TypeScript types are defined and exported
- [ ] Usage examples are provided for new functionality
- [ ] Architecture documentation is updated if structure or patterns change

## Code Documentation Standards

- Every public function, class, interface, and type must have JSDoc documentation.
- All TypeScript types and interfaces must be documented.
- Usage examples must be included in JSDoc for public functions and components.

## README Documentation Standards

- When adding new API endpoints, update the API Endpoints section in README.md.
- When adding new features, document them in the Features section of README.md.

## Architecture Documentation

- When changing project structure, update the Project Structure section in README.md and/or docs/architecture.md.

## Usage Examples

- Always include usage examples in JSDoc for new functions and components.

## Failure Consequences

If documentation is not updated:

1. Task is incomplete and cannot be marked as done.
2. Must go back and add documentation before proceeding.
3. Code review will fail; documentation is required for approval.

## Documentation File Locations

- Code documentation: JSDoc inline, type definitions in the same file, API docs in README.md or dedicated files.
- Project documentation: README.md, docs/, OpenAPI/Swagger files.
- Architecture documentation: README.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/api-patterns.md.

## Quick Reference Checklist (before commit)

- [ ] All public functions have JSDoc
- [ ] All types/interfaces are documented
- [ ] README.md is updated if needed
- [ ] Usage examples are provided
- [ ] Architecture changes are documented

## Documentation Checklist

- [ ] What: What does this code do?
- [ ] How: How do you use it?
- [ ] Why: Why was this approach chosen?
- [ ] Examples: Are there usage examples?
- [ ] Types: Are all types properly documented?
